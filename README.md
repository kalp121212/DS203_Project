# Analysis of different university ranking systems around the world and predicting rankings of the universities for future years

### Course Project - DS 203 - Programming for Data Science - Autumn Semester 2021

*Abstract—Quality education is essential for socio-economic
growth, better standards of living and advances in technology.
There are numerous ranking systems globally that rank university on the quality of overall education imparted by them. Our
work involves Exploratory Data Analysis of the datasets of three
of these ranking systems. The inferences from this shall be used
to identify trends/biases in these ranking systems. Relation of the
rank with various parameters and scores used by the ranking
system shall also be identified. Using the aggregate score over
past years a predictive model shall be trained to predict future
rankings using the principles of regression.*
